# Hammersley-Clifford theorem

``` r
library(spIBDerverse)
```

This is based on Lusher, Koskinen, and Robins (2012).

## Besag (1974)

This gives an alternative proof of the Hammersley-Clifford theorem and
is used for spatial lattices.

## Frank and Strauss (1986)

This paper shows that sufficient statistics for Markov graphs are counts
of triangles and stars.

## Robins and Pattison (2009)

This extends the types of graphs described including $p^{*}$ models, and
hence early ERGMs
