In this vignette, we look at a method to identify edges that are more prominent than expected if the nodes attributes had not effect on the probability of an edge. 

Consider a network with $N$ nodes and $E$ edges. From this, we get that the probability at two randomly selected nodes have an edge connected them is 

$$
p_{ij} = \frac{E}{{N \choose 2}}
