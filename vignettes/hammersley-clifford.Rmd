This is based on @lusher2012. 

# @besag1974
This gives an alternative proof of the Hammersley-Clifford theorem and is used for spatial lattices. 

# @frank1986
This paper shows that sufficient statistics for Markov graphs are counts of triangles and stars. 

# @robins2009
This extends the types of graphs described including $p^*$ models, and hence early ERGMs
